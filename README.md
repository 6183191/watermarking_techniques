# Several Watermarking techniques in Matlab
As part of a course the following watermarking techniques were tested in order to find out how robust a watermark can be.  
The projects flow was as follows:
-Embbed the watermark in any method
-Attack the watermarked images with the attacks included in the folder ATTACKS
-Attempt to detect the watermark in the attacked image

the code presented is not perfect at all, and in some cases it is wrong but I will not attempt to fix it since the project is done. The method that won is the DWT.
